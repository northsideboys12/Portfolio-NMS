# Personal Web Portfolio
This repository showcases my core projects, 
technical skills, and professional achievements.

Built using pure HTML, CSS, and vanilla 
JavaScript to demonstrate a strong command of 
front-end fundamentals.

Serving as both a professional showcase and a 
tool for academic or technical evaluation.

Feel free to explore the different sections 
to learn more about my journey and key projects [here](
